# auth_dev

This repo contains all the source for the hospital authorisation project .

This repo can be booked out and deployed to a working mip core-tech environment. You'll need to ensure that the database definitions are up to date on your personal machine before you clone this repo to your own machine.

TODO: add .df files to this repo as well , to make it easy to load database definitions . We'll need to ensure that the .df files always go along with the source in this file . Deltas are going to make this a bit tricky . Will have to think about a solution , because the source is often strongly coupled to the database defintions .

TODO: write a program that creates some dummy data to enable auth testing on the developer's local machine
